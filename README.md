# Annotation Interface

![A screenshot of the Anki-style labeling interface of the repository software](/static/assets/interface-screenshot.png)

A simple web application interface for annotating images of any kind. 
Point the application to the folder where images are stored on your hard drive and enjoy a clean Anki-style labeling interface with labels bound to home-row keys.
This application does not require internet access and can be run entirely locally on your computer.
It is a "web" application only insofar that the interface was created for viewing inside of a browser, but it does not require online access and does not send your data or store it anywhere besides your hard drive.
